# Swapper Coding Challenge Instructions

A coding challenge for Titans Finance | The APIS Foundation

Recommended time: 2-4 hours.

> Please do not spend more than 4 hours on this project.

> Note: You may choose to develop this small web application frontend with MetaMask and web3|ethers.js, or instead produce the same swap functionality in a headless format with a small node.js application -- if you prefer.

## Goal

### Write an application that functions similarly to Uniswap

You may use Kyber.Network to do this, or you may write your own smart contracts, or use another service that is already deployed.
 
 Kyber's web3 documentation: https://developer.kyber.network/docs/Integrations-Web3Guide/

Here are some Ether faucets:

- Ropsten https://faucet.ropsten.be/
- Ropsten https://faucet.dimensions.network/

- Rinkeby https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
- Rinkeby http://rinkeby-faucet.com/
- Rinkeby https://rinkeby.faucet.epirus.io/

> Note: the kyber developer guide uses Ropsten network

Only one hardcoded trading pair is necessary to achieve the challenge goal. Displaying MetaMask wallet balances, etc, is not necessary.


## Challenge Option 1: Frontend with MetaMask and Web3|Ethers.js

Build this product:

1. The minimal UI and functionality shown in the mockup (don't worry about precise layout, etc).
2. Connect Metamask functionality.
3. Swap one token or ETH to another token or ETH -- any token, it does not matter which, and it may be hardcoded.

 
 ## Challenge Option 2: Headeless Node.js Backend with Web3|Ethers.js 
 
 Build this product:

 1. Headless node.js service, invoked by command line, script, or HTTP request
 2. Interface that swaps one token or ETH to another token or ETH -- any token, it does not matter which, and it may be hardcoded.
